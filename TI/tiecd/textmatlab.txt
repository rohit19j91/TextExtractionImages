Text data present in images and video contain useful information for automatic
 annotation, indexing, and structuring of images.Extraction of this information
 involves detection, localization, tracking, extraction, enhancement, and 
recognition of the text from a given image. However, variations of text due to
 differences in size, style, orientation, and alignment, as well as low image 
contrast and complex background make the problem of automatic text extraction 
extremely challenging. TIE(Text-Information-Extraction)System takes an image
 as output and gives the user the following 
options :-

1) Point Detection- It detects and displays all interest points in the given image.

2) Edge Detection- It detects and displays all the edges in the given image using 
Robert's Algorithm.

3) Angular Rotation- It rotates the image at an angle of 45 degree.

4) Segmentation- It displays the image after segmentation has been applied to it.

5) Text Extraction- It highlights the text in the given image.
